**Insights**

**Weekday vs Weekend Shopping Behavior**   : The analysis reveals that customers tend to shop more on weekdays than weekends, reflecting a clear weekday preference in shopping patterns.


**Credit Card Dominance & Customer Satisfaction** : Credit cards were the most widely used payment method, accounting for 78% of all transactions, with Boleto trailing behind at 18%. Additionally, 74% of orders 
                                                    paid via credit cards received a review score of 4 or 5, highlighting the ease of use, efficiency, and higher customer satisfaction associated with credit card 
                                                    usage.

**Sao Paulo City**: Customers from Sao Paulo placed the highest number of orders and made the most payments. However, the average payment value and price per product from Sao Paulo were lower than the overall 
                   average for Olist Store.  

**Customer Satisfaction & Delivery Times**: Over 76% of orders on the Olist store received a review score of 4 or above, demonstrating strong sales performance. However, orders that took longer to deliver 
                                            received lower review scores, compared to those with faster delivery times, showing the impact of delivery speed on customer satisfaction.

** "Cama_mesa_banho" (Bed, Bath, and Table) was the most popular product category in terms of the number of orders placed .   **         





**SUGGESTIONS**

**Leveraging Customer Feedback & Loyalty Programs**: The Olist store should capitalize on its positive customer reviews to attract new and potential customers. Implementing loyalty programs will help boost customer retention. Additionally, the low order cancellation rate suggests overall customer satisfaction with their purchases. 

**Promotional Schemes for Weekend Sales**: To improve weekend sales, the Olist store should introduce promotional offers, especially targeting credit card payments, as they are the most popular payment method.


**Targeting Sao Paulo for High-Value Sales**:  Since a significant portion of orders come from Sao Paulo, but customers there spend less on high-value products, the Olist store should focus on enhanced marketing strategies and improving delivery services for high-value products in the city.



**Enhancing Logistics for Faster Delivery** : The Olist store should focus on optimizing delivery methods and reducing freight costs by improving logistics. This will help lower delivery expenses, result in better customer reviews, and enhance customer satisfaction, ultimately driving more orders and attracting new customers.


**Utilizing Customer Reviews for Insights** : Regularly monitoring and analyzing customer reviews will provide valuable insights into product quality and highlight areas for improvement. Using dashboards to track and identify patterns in reviews will enable a data driven approach to enhancing the customer experience.





**CONCULSION**

For Olist to maximize sales performance, profitability, and customer
satisfaction, the company will need to carefully employ different pricing
strategies, e.g. employ the use of Cross-sales promotion strategies for products
with high AOV like computers, and tech products to boost sales and
profitability.


Olist needs to employ loyalty programs to help improve customer retention
rates. Customers seem to be satisfied with their orders based on the result of
the low customer cancelation rate. Olist will have to capitalize on this by
putting positive customer feedback on its platform to help attract new and
potential customers.


Olist can implement dynamic pricing strategies for low-profit margin products
like home appliances by offering discounts during slow periods or raising
prices during peak seasons to improve profitability and optimize sales.

Customer cancelation rate is low and customer retention rate is equally
low. Olist will have to employ strategies to improve customer retention
rate by putting up more variety of products and looking into their
customer service experience as some customers might have been put
off by their customer service experience. They should also employ
discounting techniques and other sales promotion methods like
volume discounts on computers, their accessories, and other high
average order value products. This will ensure they are price competitive
in the market. Customers might have been getting better deals and
promotions from competitors.


Sao Paolo retained over 45% of customer density across Olist customers
but has a very low retention rate. Olist must prioritize states like Sao
Paolo and Rio de Janeiro by offering sales discounts, free shipping, and
returns.
